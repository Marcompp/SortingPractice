# SortingPractice

Python application that provides a graphical demonstration of various sorting algorithms, made for the purpose of practice. 

This application uses the Tkinter library to display and animate the sorting process, allowing users to see how different algorithms operate in real-time. Users can select the number of elements to sort, choose a sorting algorithm, and control the sorting process with options to generate new data, start, pause, stop, and perform an instant sort.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Tim Sort
- Shell Sort

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Tkinter

## Usage
```sh
python main.py
```
## File Structure

- `main.py`: Main application script.
- `generate.py`: Module for generating random data and color mapping.
- `sort.py`: Module containing various sorting algorithms and their generators.
